To-Do List:
========

A. Scrolls:

1. Rename "Absolute Scroll" to "Scroll of Teleportation":
This type of scrolls doesn't contain information about his creator, coordinates of the linked Home Block or something else. If you use it with Home Blocks, its Description should be empty.
It also should be a command to get this type of scrolls - /scroll <Description of the Scroll> [Coordinates]. If we don't use coordinates-option, scroll must get our currently position.

2. Add a little method based on "isOP" option to "Scroll of Return" for allowing OPs to return even to destroyed Home Blocks. Useful for handling of the complaints.

3. Remove altars, keep only Home Blocks.

4. Add some supernatural effect to Home Block when player moves to it.

5. Add 3D Model to Home Block based on Enchantment Table.

6. Add a Spawn Teleportation Scroll.

7. Let players to change names of the Scrolls in the Anvil.
