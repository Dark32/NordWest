To-Do List:
========
 - Add TileEntity that can contain NBTTags;
 - Add 3D model to our Altar.

Bugs:
========
 - You can see the whole block collision box, while using Flint & Steel on candle (http://i.imgur.com/SWqBBNX.png);
 - You can use F&S on candle to set fire on separate blocks;
 - You can set fire on the Altar using F&S while sneaking;
 - You cannot stand on the top of the Extractor block;
  - Probably, Collision Box of the Extractor should be fixed.
 - Candles don't fall when there are no blocks under them, so you can set candles on the air.
